  'A group of friends decided to go on a hiking trip. They packed their bags with various items, including a backpack. After they finished packing, they weighed the backpack, and the scales showed w kilos. They were excited to start their adventure, but they faced a problem. The friends are all fans of even numbers, and they want to divide the weight of the backpack in such a way that each of the two parts weighs an even number of kilos. However, it is not necessary for the parts to be equal. They are eager to begin their hike as soon as possible, so they need your help to determine if they can divide the weight of the backpack as they want. Each person should receive a part of positive weight. Input: The first (and only) input line contains an integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the backpack. Output: Print "YES" if the friends can divide the weight of the backpack into two parts, each weighing an even number of kilos. Print "NO" otherwise.',
  "A family of explorers discovered a hidden treasure chest in a cave during their expedition. The chest was too heavy to carry as a whole, so they decided to divide its weight equally among themselves. However, they had a peculiar requirement - each person wanted their share of the weight to be an even number of kilos. Can you help them determine if it is possible to divide the weight of the treasure chest in such a way? Print YES if it is possible, and NO otherwise.",
